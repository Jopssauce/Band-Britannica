  missionTitle: Battle at Castle Guinnion
  missionDescription: After the massive losses of Sir Brunor's Knightly Order at the
    River Dubglas, we were ordered to recuperate our numbers until we could sufficiently
    fight again. Our rest was short lived though, our numbers still less than a few
    hundred were ordered to circle around the enemy camp and attack the siege engines
    at Castle Guinnion. Its most likely that we will meet our end here today but let
    it be a glorious one!
