  missionTitle: Battle of River Glein
  missionDescription: Well men and women today is tomorrow and you know what that
    means, its time to get to work. Out there are food and supplies going to the enemy
    camp, your job is to "appropriate" those items of interest. Lucky for you folks
    this is a job where you'll have to be crippled to not live through this. Now seeing
    as your bowels lived through yesterday I'd say you're ready for this now go out
    there and be winners.
