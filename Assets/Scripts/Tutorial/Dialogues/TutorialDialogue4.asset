  - Alright now you have the basics of the basics down here are the rest of your supposed
    castable skill.
  - 'Remember when there are more enemies <color=yellow>you can choose which enemy
    to attack by left clicking them.</color> '
  - Now a bit of some last piece of advice.
  - When you cast skills you can increase their intensity by matching more tiles in
    their respective combinations.
  - Say Fireball, you get the normal amount of damage by just matching 3 Fire tiles
    and 3 Air tiles.
  - But if you match 5 Fire tiles and 5 Air Tiles, you can maximize the damage your
    Fireball can deal but that's just an example though.
  - Alright now finish your training and remember,
  - Have a smile on when you are smiting the enemies of King Arthur.
