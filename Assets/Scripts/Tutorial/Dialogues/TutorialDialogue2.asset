  Dialogues:
  - Now that you've matched some tiles. Notice on the top center that the bar has
    filled up.
  - That bar is your <color=yellow>Team Attack Gauge</color>
  - Once that fill up fully your team will unleash <color=blue> A MASSIVE TEAM ATTACK</color>
    on your selected enemy.
  - But notice how this went down awhile ago when you were matching?
  - That is your <color=blue>Mana Gauge</color> when that reaches<color=yellow> zero</color>
    you won't be able to match tiles anymore.
  - Now you see that the enemy's numbers are pulsating red that mean they are <color=red>about
    to attack</color>.
  - Get them bowels ready!
