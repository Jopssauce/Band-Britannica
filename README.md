# Band Britannica (College Project)
**This project requires Unity 2018.3.0f2**

Band Britannica is a Third Person RPG Turn Based Match-3 singleplayer game. Use Match-3 to activate skills, spells, combos and a team attack to decimate your enemies! I worked multiple roles for this project to makeup for our lack of team members. I took the remaining important work by programming some of the games systems, designing the game, and creating the voxel style art and VFX seen throughout the game. The game has recieved the award of Best Capstone 3 during the Benilde March Incendium 2019. **[Game Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWc5KTP8SHw&feature=emb_logo)**

### Match3

The Match3/Turn Based mechanic is will responsible for allowing the player to make actions and decisions to defeat the
opposing team. The match system works where the player matches 3 of the same tile then once that has been achieved they can then match up to another 3 of either the same tile or a different tile. Example is matching 3 fire tiles then being able to match 3 air tiles after. 
So long as the player has mana they match tiles in any direction to their heartâ€™s
content (e.g., Max mana is 10 then players can match up to 10 tiles at a time).

### Skills

Continuing on, this is where the activation of skill come in according to their tile requirement, Air + Fire = Backstab and etc.

### Combos and Skill Intensity

The combo and intensity system also come to play in this point. Player being able to match a number of tiles at a time will allow them to cast multiple skills at once but for the skills activate they have to be in the EXACT order of the required tiles (e.g., Fire + Air = Fireball while Air + Fire != Fireball).

### Stages

The player will have to play through multiple levels called stages. The main goal of each stage will always be to defeat the opposing team. As the player moves on to new stages different enemies will propose new challenges to the player.
